# Task-4---Feed-back-system

The Servo motor is connected to the Arduino through pin 4 and there is a potintiometer through pin A0.

the potintiometer signal is mapped from 0 to 1023 and written on the servo motor to give an angel from 0 to 180.

when the potintiometer is rotated the directly attached servo will rotate accordingly.

the wire connected from the first to the second will send a feedback, and that feed back wil act as the signal for the second arduino.

so the second servo will rotate the same as the frist servo through the feed back wire.
